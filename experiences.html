                        My recent trip to Singapore was a wonderful experience that not only allowed me to explore the
                        city's beauty but also helped me expand my professional network. I met many people from
                        universities, industry professionals, and professors, which was a great learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had the opportunity to bond with new friends from the National University of Singapore
                        (NUS) andthe Singapore Management University(SMU). We explored the city together and tried some
                        of the local delicacies, which broadened my perspective and understanding of different cultures.

                    <p>
                        The city's transportation system was efficient, clean, and affordable, which made it easy for me
                        to get around and explore different parts of the city. Additionally, the food was diverse, and I
                        enjoyed exploring the different options available, from hawker centers to high-end restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, the people of Singapore were warm, friendly, and welcoming, and I learned a lot about
                        their fascinating culture. Overall, it was an unforgettable trip that I will cherish for a long
                        time.
