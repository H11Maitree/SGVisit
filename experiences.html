                        As I reflect on my recent 5-day academic trip to Singapore, I can't help but feel grateful for
                        the fantastic experiences I had there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon arriving in Singapore on the first day, I was filled with excitement and anticipation for
                        what was to come. The next day, I had the opportunity to visit the National University of
                        Singapore (NUS) and attend a fascinating lecture. During lunch and the lab visit, I had the
                        chance to network with fellow academics and see the impressive research facilities at NUS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third day was also packed with activities as I visited the office of Carousell, where I
                        learned about e-commerce and start-ups in Singapore. I then went to the Singapore Management
                        University (SMU) to learn from experts in my field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all the academic activities, I took a break on the fourth day and explored Singapore. I
                        visited the Sentosa Island Aquarium, a great way to learn about marine life and have fun.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the final day, I returned to Hong Kong feeling refreshed and inspired by my trip. Overall, it
                        was an enriching experience that allowed me to learn from experts in my field, network with
                        fellow academics, and explore a new place. I can't wait for my next academic trip!

                        This five-day visit to Singapore, facilitated by CityU as an overseas university field trip, served as a serendipitous experience that broadened my perspectives, particularly in the context of Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>
                        Visiting NUS and SMU helped me comprehend the dynamics of Singapore's university system, particularly their cutting-edge research and the brilliant minds contributing to computer science and technology. Moreover, this trip provided a glimpse of the opportunities Singapore offers to its graduate scholars. Our office visit to Carousell Singapore was inspiring and joyful, overflowing with insightful details about their journey from being a startup to a globally-operated company.</p>
                    <p>
                        The self-guided explorations proved to be memorable experiences, with visits to famed Singapore attractions such as the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, and Sentosa, as well as savoring delectable Singaporean cuisine.</p>
                    <p>
                       Lastly, the tasks assigned to the visiting team before and after the visit provided an exceptional opportunity to practice teamwork, enabling us to plan the trip and create this webpage. Overall, this trip would not have been possible without the support from CityU, NUS, and SMU, particularly from our team and our mentors, Dr. Howard and Dr. Kenneth.</p>

                        The study tour was an extraordinary experience that I am eager to share with everyone. It provided us with an exclusive opportunity to visit two esteemed universities, SMU and NUS, as well as the renowned company Carousell, spanning across both Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Throughout the journey, I was continuously impressed by the academic and professional insights I gained as a Computer Science student.
                    </p>
                    <p>Beyond those visits, we fully immersed ourselves in the vibrant culture of Singapore. I myself was fascinated by the blend of old and new, where historical landmarks stood in harmony with modern skyscrapers. This immersive experience broadened our horizons and fostered a deep appreciation for the rich cultural heritage that Singapore proudly embodies.

                        My recent trip to Singapore was a wonderful experience that not only allowed me to explore the
                        city's beauty but also helped me expand my professional network. I met many people from
                        universities, industry professionals, and professors, which was a great learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had the opportunity to bond with new friends from the National University of Singapore
                        (NUS) andthe Singapore Management University(SMU). We explored the city together and tried some
                        of the local delicacies, which broadened my perspective and understanding of different cultures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city's transportation system was efficient, clean, and affordable, which made it easy for me
                        to get around and explore different parts of the city. Additionally, the food was diverse, and I
                        enjoyed exploring the different options available, from hawker centers to high-end restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, the people of Singapore were warm, friendly, and welcoming, and I learned a lot about
                        their fascinating culture. Overall, it was an unforgettable trip that I will cherish for a long
                        time.

                        This excursion proved to be a gratifying endeavor, as it not only afforded me the opportunity
                        to immerse myself in the city's aesthetic allure but also expanded my perspective of technology
                        and the field of computer science. I had the pleasure of meeting with a multitude of individuals
                        hailing from esteemed educational institutions and multinational corporations.

                        Singapore Management University (SMU) was engaging and helpful for prospective graduates. I
                        particularly like the trip to Carousell where we were offered an insightful glimpse into the
                        startup scene of Singapore and the working processes of an e-commerce company.

                        of its manifold cultural treasures and indulging in the local delights. From the wilderness we
                        witnessed atop Sentosa cable cars to the exquisite light and water show Spectra, this communal
                        pursuit served to broaden my horizons and cultivate an understanding of how to blend nature and

                        I feel grateful for the valuable experiences and memories that I gained. The trip allowed me to
                        explore a new city, immerse myself in a different culture, and learn from experts in the IT
                        field. It was a great opportunity to bond with new friends and expand my professional network.

                    <p>
                        One of the highlights of the trip was the chance to visit academic institutions such as the
                        National University of Singapore and the Singapore Management University. Attending lectures
                        and networking with fellow academics helped me gain new perspectives and insights into my field
                        of study.

                    <p>
                        Aside from the academic activities, I also enjoyed exploring different parts of the city, trying
                        local delicacies, and admiring the jaw-dropping scenery of Singapore. The warmth and friendliness
                        of the people of Singapore made the trip even more memorable.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, during the trip, I had the opportunity to become the leader of Group 3. This role
                        allowed me to develop and practice my leadership skills, especially in coordinating and delegating
                        tasks to ensure the success of our group's activities. I learned how to communicate effectively
                        with my team members and motivate them to work towards our common goals. I am grateful for this
                        chance to learn and grow, and I know that the skills I acquired during the trip will be valuable
                        in my future endeavors.

                    <p>
                        Overall, the trip was an enriching and unforgettable experience that broadened my horizons and
                        left me with a deeper appreciation for different cultures. I feel lucky to have had such an
                        opportunity and look forward to more adventures in the future. Thank you Dr. Howard Leung and
                        Dr. Kenneth Lee for holding this study tour and allowing me to participate in it.

                        As our Singapore Visit 2023 comes to an end, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences, knowledge, and cultural exposure we have gained. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Department of Computer Science of CityU, Dr. Leung, and Dr. Lee for their unwavering support and guidance throughout this journey.

                    <p>
                        Singapore is a truly wonderful place, with its perfect blend of nature and urban development. The city's natural environment is well-preserved, and the people we encountered were warm, friendly, and diverse. The food, from the mouth-watering Hainanese chicken at CHIN CHIN to the delightful kaya toast at Ya Kun, was a delightful culinary adventure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Our visits to institutions like NUS, SMU, and Carousell have left a lasting impression on me, especially the innovative projects and dedication to excellence displayed by the students and professionals. It's inspiring to see how they are shaping the future of computing and technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This trip has not only been an opportunity to learn and grow academically, but also a chance to bond with my fellow students and experience the rich cultural tapestry of Singapore. I am grateful for this 5-days outbound experience supported by CityU, and I am excited to apply the knowledge and inspiration I have gained to my final year study.

                        In this 5-day tour visit, I learned a lot about how to collaborate with the others with
                        different cultural backgrounds. This experience is very valuable since it is not easy to gather
                        local and non-local students in an oversea trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from the official activities, we have explored some famous sightseeing places in spare
                        time such as Marina Bay Sand, Clarke Quay and Sentosa. Also, we have tasted various fresh
                        durians in four popular durian stores which are in different residential areas. In the
                        meanwhile, we have experienced their local culture such as taking transportation to non-tourist
                        area, buying household goods from the local grocery store and talking with local residence in
                        the restaurant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides, I have learned how to use the professional software to design the props. During the
                        trip, I have familiarized the photo taking and video shooting skills. After that, I have learned
                        how to edit the video as well. This is a great chance to me to practice those useful multimedia
                        editing techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At last, I have Dr. Howard LEUNG and Dr. Kenneth LEE to thank for giving me the chance to
                        participate in this memorable trip as well as enriching my wonderful University Life.
