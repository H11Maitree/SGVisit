                        As I reflect on my recent 5-day academic trip to Singapore, I can't help but feel grateful for
                        the fantastic experiences I had there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon arriving in Singapore on the first day, I was filled with excitement and anticipation for
                        what was to come. The next day, I had the opportunity to visit the National University of
                        Singapore (NUS) and attend a fascinating lecture. During lunch and the lab visit, I had the
                        chance to network with fellow academics and see the impressive research facilities at NUS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third day was also packed with activities as I visited the office of Carousell, where I
                        learned about e-commerce and start-ups in Singapore. I then went to the Singapore Management
                        University (SMU) to learn from experts in my field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all the academic activities, I took a break on the fourth day and explored Singapore. I
                        visited the Sentosa Island Aquarium, a great way to learn about marine life and have fun.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the final day, I returned to Hong Kong feeling refreshed and inspired by my trip. Overall, it
                        was an enriching experience that allowed me to learn from experts in my field, network with
                        fellow academics, and explore a new place. I can't wait for my next academic trip!

                        My recent trip to Singapore was a wonderful experience that not only allowed me to explore the
                        city's beauty but also helped me expand my professional network. I met many people from
                        universities, industry professionals, and professors, which was a great learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had the opportunity to bond with new friends from the National University of Singapore
                        (NUS) andthe Singapore Management University(SMU). We explored the city together and tried some
                        of the local delicacies, which broadened my perspective and understanding of different cultures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city's transportation system was efficient, clean, and affordable, which made it easy for me
                        to get around and explore different parts of the city. Additionally, the food was diverse, and I
                        enjoyed exploring the different options available, from hawker centers to high-end restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, the people of Singapore were warm, friendly, and welcoming, and I learned a lot about
                        their fascinating culture. Overall, it was an unforgettable trip that I will cherish for a long
                        time.

                        In this 5-day tour visit, I learned a lot about how to collaborate with the others with
                        different cultural backgrounds. This experience is very valuable since it is not easy to gather
                        local and non-local students in an oversea trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from the official activities, we have explored some famous sightseeing places in spare
                        time such as Marina Bay Sand, Clarke Quay and Sentosa. Also, we have tasted various fresh
                        durians in four popular durian stores which are in different residential areas. In the
                        meanwhile, we have experienced their local culture such as taking transportation to non-tourist
                        area, buying household goods from the local grocery store and talking with local residence in
                        the restaurant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides, I have learned how to use the professional software to design the props. During the
                        trip, I have familiarized the photo taking and video shooting skills. After that, I have learned
                        how to edit the video as well. This is a great chance to me to practice those useful multimedia
                        editing techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At last, I have Dr. Howard LEUNG and Dr. Kenneth LEE to thank for giving me the chance to
                        participate in this memorable trip as well as enriching my wonderful University Life.

                        My recent excursion to Singapore proved to be a gratifying endeavor, as it not only afforded me
                        the opportunity to immerse myself in the city's aesthetic allure but also expanded my perspective
                        of technology and the field of computer science. I had the pleasure of meeting with a multitude
                        of individuals hailing from esteemed educational institutions and multinational corporations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sharing of professors and students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the
                        Singapore Management University (SMU) was engaging and helpful for prospective graduates. I
                        particularly like the trip to Carousell where we were offered an insightful glimpse into the
                        startup scene of Singapore and the working processes of an e-commerce company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of the scheduled activities, we traversed the city's expanse, partaking in the exploration
                        of its manifold cultural treasures and indulging in the local delights. From the wilderness we
                        witnessed atop Sentosa cable cars to the exquisite light and water show Spectra, this communal
                        pursuit served to broaden my horizons and cultivate an understanding of how to blend nature and
                        societal development.

                        I came back home still wanting to unravel more of the marvel that is Singapore. This odyssey will
                        certainly remain etched in the recesses of my memory, evoking fond recollections for years to come.
