## Signature Singaporean Shows 
After an exhilarating day on Sentosa Island, we immersed ourselves in two signature nighttime outdoor shows near Bayfront Station: The Spectra Light & Water Show at the Event Plaza and Garden Rhapsody at Gardens By The Bay.

## The Spectra
Crowds gathered at 8 pm in front of the mammoth mall, clearly awaiting an event and making the location of The Spectra easy to identify. Attendees reserved their spots early to secure the best view of the 15-minute spectacle.

### Cutting-edge Automated Art
The show features automated water fountains, lasers, and projectors. The interplay between the fountains and projectors is intriguing, as the water spray creates a makeshift screen for the projected animations. The lasers, seemingly projected from the distant Marina Bay Sands Hotel building, further enhance the visual treat. The synchronization of technology is impressive, making it a top free show to experience in the bay area.

## Gardens By The Bay
Following the first show, we traversed the bridge near the center of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel building to the other side of the bay, hurriedly aiming to catch the Garden Rhapsody show, commencing approximately 20 minutes after The Spectra concludes. Despite the darkness, the crowd from the previous show collectively journeyed to the next.

### The Supertrees
Upon entering the park, we were awestruck by a scene reminiscent of Pandora from the movie Avatar. The towering artificial trees dwarfed the spectators, creating a fantastical and exotic atmosphere. Each tree, adorned with multitudes of LEDs, displayed captivating patterns reminiscent of a computer screensaver.

Without much delay, the announcement for that evening's show, "World of Fantasy," echoed as people began to lay down to watch the giant trees' symphony.

### Songs of Childhood
The show evoked nostalgia through well-known tunes from shows including "Part of Your World" from The Little Mermaid, "Adventure and Dinosaurs" from Jurassic Park, and "Wizardry Magic" from Harry Potter. The 15-minute spectacle flew by, an enchanting display of thousands of LED lights paired with sound, story, and the iconic backdrop of Singapore's renowned hotel, elevating it to one of Singapore's top signature shows.

## The Spectra vs Garden Rhapsody
During our ride home, we debated which show was superior. While one member preferred The Spectra for its technologically advanced performance, I found the Garden Rhapsody more emotive due to the meaningful content displayed, despite the seemingly simpler technology behind the show.
