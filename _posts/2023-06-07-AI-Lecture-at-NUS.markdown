## Arrive at NUS
On our first morning in Singapore, we took the MRT to Kent Ridge station, where NUS is located, then went inside the campus by bus. We were impressed by the abundance of greeneries inside NUS, even though it was only from a cursory look. We then moved into the auditorium building where the lecture would take place.

## Lecture on Logical Agents
Leading the lecture is Dr. Daren Ler, a professor from Department of Computer Science at NUS. In the span of over an hour, he gave us an overview of logical agents, an important tool to represent knowledge and deduce information about the environment. Through straightforward examples, he introduced the foundational components of logical agents and elucidated their rigorous formulation in a superbly clear manner. Dr. Daren also condensed the material into digestible summaries, helping us retained it better.

After the lecture, we also talked to the  students taking the class and got to know more about the university life in NUS. We expressed our gratitude to Daren before parted way with him.
