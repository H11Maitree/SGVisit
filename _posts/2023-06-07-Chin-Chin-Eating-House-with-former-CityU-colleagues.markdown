## Host Favorites at Chin Chin Eating House with former CityU colleagues
We enjoyed an exceptional lunch at Chin Chin Eating House, recommended by our hosts: Dr. NGO Chong Wah, Dr. YANG Guomin, and Dr. HE Shengfeng. Currently professors at the Singapore School of Computing and Information Systems, Management University, they guided us to this local gem situated a brief 15-minute walk from the SMU campus.

During lunchtime, the bustling restaurant serves renowned Singaporean cuisine, particularly Hainanese chicken rice, and accommodates guests at traditional Asian rotating round tables. Despite the crowd, every table buzzes with anticipation for their serving of chicken.

## Highlight: Hainanese Chicken Rice
The star of the meal is the Hainanese chicken, made tender through a slow poaching technique. The chicken, shared among us, was glazed with a unique Hainanese-style sauce, a harmonious blend of ginger, garlic, and pandan leaves.

## Side dishes and Appetizers
Beyond Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chin Chin Eating House offers a wide array of Singaporean and Southeast Asian-influenced favorites. We enjoyed Sambal Kangkong, Cereal Prawns, Foo Young Omelet, and Hainanese Prawn Rolls. The sambal kangkong, a spicy water spinach dish prepared with Belachan (fermented shrimp paste), provided a taste of authentic Singapore-Malay cuisine.

There, we looked forward to engaging in insightful discussions with our esteemed hosts. Our hosts, Dr. NGO Chong Wah, Dr. YANG Guomin, and Dr. HE Shengfeng, all have backgrounds linked to CityU.

Notably, Dr. Wah was the lead professor of a 2009 CityU student trip to Singapore and Malaysia, and he presented us with a booklet from that journey. This document serves as a key inspiration for our current trip.

During our meeting, Dr. Guomin shared personal anecdotes and images from his storied journey.
