## A Full Day to Spend on Sentosa Island
Given a full day to explore the country on our own, many of us decided to head to Sentosa Island. With numerous attractions to choose from, we agreed that visiting the S.E.A. Aquarium was a must. Some of us had never been to such a place before, and the bright and sunny weather made it an ideal choice to kickstart the trip.

## The S.E.A. Aquarium
As one of the largest aquariums globally, the S.E.A. Aquarium houses over 100,000 marine animals. From the moment we stepped inside, immediately we were captivated. We couldn't help appreciate the astonishing beauty and delicate details of the underwater world.

## Raising Environmental Awareness
Beyond the entertainment and excitement, our visit to the S.E.A. Aquarium also provided us with a valuable lesson about the impact of ocean pollution. We learned about what we can do as global citizens and the importance of preserving the resources, shared among uncountable species. The knowledgeable volunteers there shared insightful information, making our experience meaningful and thought-provoking.
