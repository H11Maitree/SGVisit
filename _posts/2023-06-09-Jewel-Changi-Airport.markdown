## The Last Stop
After an adventurous journey, our final exploration in Singapore brings us to The Jewel. This must-visit destination for air-bound tourists is nestled in the heart of Changi Airport. We intentionally scheduled extra time to reach the airport early via the MRT, allowing us ample opportunity to marvel at the modern architecture and natural themes of this entertainment and retail complex. Despite Changi Airport's long history, the complex only opened in 2019, a mere four years ago, marking a first-time visit for most of our group.

We arrived at the Airport station in Terminal 2 via the MRT at 3 PM, and quickly headed to check-in at Terminal 4, the newly constructed terminal, a mere 10-minute shuttle bus ride away. We were all eager to witness the colossal waterfall in The Jewel post-check-in, so we boarded the shuttle bus once more to The Jewel.

## Remarkable Scene of The Grate Waterfall
Our arrival at the main entrance of The Jewel filled us with awe, as we saw water cascading from the 40-meter-tall curved ceiling. This majestic backdrop, paired with the lush, verdant plants in the foreground, provided a refreshing ambiance ahead of our lengthy flight.

Therefore, we took our last group photo here, with the waterfall in the background, before scattering to peruse the complex's shops for souvenirs.

## Things To Do
Surprisingly, The Jewel is not sequestered in the airport's passenger area behind security and immigration. This makes it accessible to locals and passengers alike who are waiting for their check-in to open. It's a strategic plan to alleviate passenger boredom, offering a plethora of activities pre-flight, including shopping, eating, or even visiting the Airport museum.

## Sky Monorail
Every so often, the rapid inter-terminal transit railway whizzes through the air beneath the waterfall, offering a thrilling, almost sci-fi spectacle to witness.

## Say Bye to Singapore
As our boarding time loomed, we bid farewell to The Jewel and headed back to catch our flight home. This marks the end of our Singapore Visit 2023.
