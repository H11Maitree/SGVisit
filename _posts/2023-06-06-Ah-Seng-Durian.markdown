## Bittersweet
On day-2 of our Singapore Visit 2023, my friends Marco, Hendry, and I visited Ah Seng Durian’s Alexandra Outlet. We were delighted to find various fresh and affordable fruits, especially durians. We indulged in two distinctive types of durians - one with a bitter taste and another with a sweet taste.

## Durian with Mangosteen
To complement our durian feast, we also savoured some juicy mangosteens. We were pleasantly surprised by the affordability of this store compared to another we visited last night. Our experience at Ah Seng Durian was exceptional, marked by the freshness and affordability of the fruits available. It was a memorable and enjoyable time shared with good friends and exquisite tastes. I highly recommend Ah Seng Durian to all durian lovers.
