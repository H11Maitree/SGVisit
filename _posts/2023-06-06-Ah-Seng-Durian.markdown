## Bitter Sweet
On the day-2 of our Singapore Visit 2023, my friends Marco, Hendry, and I visited Ah Seng Durian's Alexandra Outlet. We were delighted to find a wide variety of fresh and affordable fruits, especially the durians. We indulged in two distinctive types of durians - one with a bitter taste and another with a sweet taste.

## Durian with Mangosteens
To complement our durian feast, we also savoured some juicy mangosteens. We were pleasantly surprised by the affordability of this store compared to others we had visited previously. Our experience at Ah Seng Durian was exceptional, marked by the freshness and affordability of the fruits available. It was a memorable and enjoyable time shared with good friends and exquisite tastes. I would highly recommend Ah Seng Durian to anyone loving durian.
