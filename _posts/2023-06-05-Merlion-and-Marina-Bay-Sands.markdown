## Rain Oculus
After enjoying a delicious dinner, my friends and I hopped on the subway with an exciting plan to visit the renowned Gardens by the Bay and Merlion. As we emerged from the subway station, we were immediately captivated by the sight of the Rain Oculus. The spinning motion of this mesmerizing installation created a cascading effect, resembling a natural waterfall. 

The flowing water continued its journey, entering the mall and transforming into a stunning indoor landscape. It was a sight to behold, blending art and nature seamlessly.
