Walking around in the scorching afternoon, I decided to find a café to rest before dinner. After searching around, I found a place right next to School of the Arts on Zubir Said Dr called [Void Cafe](https://voidcafe.com).

It was a pleasant space, with comfortable sofas and a wide range of boardgames for you to select from. The cappuccino was palatable. I played two games of Jenga before going to a bak kut teh restaurant for dinner.

Unfortunately, when I left, I forgot a small paper bag back there, and when I realized, it was too late and the café already closed. Luckily, I was able to contact the café on Messenger, and they quickly confirmed my bag was still there. The next day, I returned to the café, knowing fully well that this café shall occupy a special place in my memory of this trip.
