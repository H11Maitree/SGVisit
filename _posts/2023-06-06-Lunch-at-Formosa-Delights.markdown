After attending the lecture on artificial intelligence in NUS campus in the morning, we moved to [Formosa Delights](http://www.formosadelights.com/), a Taiwanese restaurant located near the auditorium, for lunch.

As we stepped inside the restaurant, we were greeted by an inviting ambience that blended modern aesthetics with traditional Taiwanese touches. Soft hues of red and gold adorned the walls, while intricate lanterns cast a warm glow, setting the stage for an immersive dining experience. The restaurant's attentive staff, donning traditional attire, made us feel right at home, offering friendly smiles and helpful suggestions as we perused the menu.

The menu boasted a wide array of dishes, ranging from classic favorites to lesser-known delicacies, each meticulously crafted to fit in within the Singaporean milieu. We were eager to order, and our table soon overflowed with an assortment of dishes, showcasing the diversity and creativity of Taiwanese cuisine.

The plate of succulent lamb meat cooked with garlic to a perfect tenderness took the spotlight, as well as the pot of BBQ fish in Ma La broth, which provided a delightful kick of heat for those craving a bolder experience. Tucked in-between the hefty plates and casserole of saut√©ed chicken is a tray of mayo tofu in XO sauce, a true hidden gem with its fiery, umami flavor and supple texture that melted right in your mouth.
