## The Michelin-approved restaurant
Song Fa, a remarkable restaurant recognized with a Michelin Guide award for seven consecutive years and still counting, is renowned for its enduring Bak Kut Teh - a Teochew garlic and pepper broth.

## Traditional Site
Today, we find ourselves at the Suntec City branch, situated around the circle of the Fountain of Wealth, a symbol of prosperity and life, and recognized as the world's largest fountain in 1998. The restaurant's design pays homage to its humble beginnings, preserving the aesthetic of its 1969 food cart era through its use of backless wooden chairs and classic tables. Its prime location a few feet from the Fountain of Wealth allows diners to view the fountain from within the restaurant.

## Bottomless Soup
The soup is truly memorable and bottomless, its potent blend of garlic and white pepper lending it an unmistakable Asian aroma that fills the room, even when not physically present in our bowl. The experience of having the soup constantly refilled, steaming hot from the jar, is rejuvenating. The staff make considerable efforts, continuously circulating the restaurant to ensure no customer's bowl runs dry. The pork ribs are traditionally well-stewed in the soup, maintaining a perfect balance - soft, yet with enough firmness for a satisfying chew.

## Epic sauce
The sauce is a D.I.Y affair, with each table provided with a bottle of sweet thick soy sauce, mashed chili, and sliced chili. The sweet thick soy sauce is particularly exceptional, unlike any you'd find in a supermarket, boasting a rich, creamy caramel flavor. The caramelized sweet soy sauce is so delectable it could tempt you to abscond with the bottle if it were lawful.

## The Fountain of Wealth
After our meal, we ventured outside to admire the Fountain of Wealth up close. Viewed from above, the fountain's architectural design is strikingly symmetric and modern, belying its age. At 10 pm, the fountain ceases operation for the day, pausing to rest before its mesmerizing display recommences the following morning.
