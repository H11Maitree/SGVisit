## Singapore's Theme Park Extravaganza
When one mentions Sentosa, the Universal Studios theme park is the first attraction that comes to mind, where childhood fantasies come alive amidst thrilling roller coasters and water rides. It's a short hop from Vivo City, where most people take the Sentosa monorail for a one-stop journey to "Resort World." We, however, chose to walk across the bridge under the blistering Singaporean summer sun, guided by Google Maps.

## Hollywood Street
Positioned just past the entrance, the vibrant Main Street USA-esque Hollywood Street exudes the same lively energy as Hong Kong Disneyland. Parades unfold in front of stacked souvenir shops within interconnected buildings, where children love to scamper around.

We were fortunate enough to meet the adorable Minions from Despicable Me and their boss, Gru, as well as Alex from Madagascar performing his signature dance with the children.

## Lights, Camera, Action!
"Lights, Camera, Action!" was the first attraction we embarked upon, located on New York Street adjacent to Hollywood Street. This show reveals how Universal Studios and renowned director Steven Spielberg utilize physical special effects during production, demonstrated through a simulated hurricane on a New York pier, complete with heavy rain and an explosive gas pipe rupture. The entire 10-minute spectacle is surreal, and the clandestine stage we were leaning on certainly added a surprising twist.

## A Deceptive Cultural Attraction
The Revenge of The Mummy, with its massive Egyptian-styled statue, was an attraction we were eager to explore. Internet chatter about the incongruity between its educational exterior and the frightening indoor rollercoaster inside piqued our interest. After a harrowing ride, complete with a fall from the ceiling in pitch-black darkness, we had to take a one-hour break at the Jurassic food court to recover before venturing on.

## A Splash of Adventure
The final ride we selected was the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. In a 9-seater raft, we navigated wild waterways and encountered dinosaurs. This was no mild Disney ride â€“ it was an extreme experience with an epic finale that sent our raft hurtling down a hill into a watery landing, soaking us all. At the end of the ride, we emerged as drenched as if we'd just taken a bath.
