## Continue Our Adventure on Sentosa Island with the Sentosa Line Cable Car
After an exciting exploration in S.E.A. aquarium, we all agreed to roam around the island for memory and what could be better than taking the sentosa line cable car which connects many attractions together and provides tourist with breathtaking views.

## Start of The Journey
Our journey began at the Merlion station, where we were warmly greeted by friendly and informative staff. Opting for the round-trip tickets, we had the flexibility to hop on and off at different stations. As a group of four, we shared a cable car, having a great opportunity to capture countless memorable photos.

## Shout Out My Love to the Ride and this Island
As we stepped into the cable car, the refreshing breeze provided relief from the heat. Additionally, I fell in love with the view there as it was truly amazing. One side is the endless sea view while the other is more the perfect blend of city, jungles, and attractions. It even is more fascinating with the realization that this island is artificial and truly is from the power of humankind. Our respect for Singapore grew even stronger. This ride was not only to travel from one place to the other but was for us to capture all the beautiful memories created on Sentosa island.
