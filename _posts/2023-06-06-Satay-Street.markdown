## Satay Street Experience
Adjacent to the food court, we discovered a road filled with food tables and kiosks where sellers cooked skewers on top of barbecue grills. We couldn't resist trying a set of skewers, which included shrimp, chicken, and beef, accompanied by rice cake, sweet and spicy soy sauce, and peanut sauce. The succulent shrimps were particularly delicious.

What stood out to me was the inclusivity of the place, catering to various dietary restrictions, including halal and vegetarian options. Singapore's commitment to providing halal food was evident, with separate trays for halal and non-halal food.
