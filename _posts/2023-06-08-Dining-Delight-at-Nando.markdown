When I walked into Nando's restaurant, I was immediately greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The decor was modern and eye-catching, and the staff were friendly and attentive.

## Peri Peri!
As I perused the menu, I noticed that Nando's specializes in flame-grilled peri-peri chicken, which is a type of Portuguese-style chicken that is marinated in a spicy peri-peri sauce. I decided to try the half chicken with a side of peri-peri fries and a refreshing glass of iced lemon tea.

## The spices
When my meal arrived, the chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy exterior and juicy meat inside. The peri-peri sauce had a nice kick to it, which added a delicious flavor to the chicken. The peri-peri fries were also crispy and had a spicy seasoning that complemented the chicken well.

## Recommended
Overall, my experience at Nando's was fantastic. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the staff were attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend Nando's to anyone looking for a tasty and unique dining experience in Singapore.
