## Impromptu Visit to the National Museum of Singapore
After a visit to SMU, located in the prime location, we noticed an impressive building from the other side: the national museum of Singapore. The architecture was definitely amazing, even at a glance from the outside. Hence, even though there was little time left to visit, we still wanted to walk around to see what it looked like, and that decision was worth it!

## Inside the Museum: A Glimpse into Singapore's History and Culture
The national museum of Singapore is the oldest museum providing information on history and culture. From the very first steps inside, I was really impressed by the beauty of neo-classical architecture. We got to visit a few exhibitions inside, representing the current culture of Singapore and its brief history. There were some interactive zones for us to play with, making the visit even more enjoyable.

## Reflections on the Visit and Desire to Return
Overall, it was a great experience. If there is another chance to visit Singapore, I would love to revisit this place and explore more in-depth about the history and culture of Singapore.
