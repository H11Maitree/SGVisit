## Singapore, Durian Heaven
Welcome to our first station of the durian’s journey. After exiting the MRT station, we could already notice the unique smell of the Mao Shan Wang. It is so expressed that the durian shop has a grand declaration, and the customers can taste diverse fresh durians such as Black Gold Mao Shan Wang, Mao Shan Wang, Jin Feng, D13, S17, XO, and Red Prawn (D175), and also the durian desserts here.

## First Try
Since Nurda has never tried durian, we chose the ordinary Mao Shan Wang for him. Even though it cost S$74 for two packs, it was cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. The durians tasted a little bit bittersweet with a soft and creamy texture. We, durian lovers, all satisfy these good quality durians except Nurda. He said that the taste was so rich and didn’t know why he could taste sweet and bitter simultaneously. That is his first impression of eating durian. I hope Nurda will try durian again and enjoy its taste.
