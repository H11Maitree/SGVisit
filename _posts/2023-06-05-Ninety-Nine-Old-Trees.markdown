## Singapore, Durian Heaven
Welcome to our first station of durian’s journey.
After exiting the MRT station, we could already notice that the unique smell from the Mao Shan Wang. It is so expressed that the durian shop has grand declaration, and the customers can taste diverse fresh durians and the desserts made by the durian here. There were various type of durians could be ordered, such as Black Gold Mao Shan Wang, Mao Shan Wang, Jin Feng, D13, S17, XO and Red Prawn (D175).

## First Try
Since Nurda has never tried durian, we chose the normal Mao Shan Wang for him. Even it costed S$74 for two packs, it was rather cheaper than buying from Hong Kong. The durians were tasted a little bit bittersweet with soft and creamy texture. We, durian-lovers, all satisfy these good quality durians except Nurda. He said that the taste was so richness and don’t know why he could taste sweet and bitter at the same time. That is his first impression of eating durian. I hope Nurda would try durian again and enjoy its taste in the future.
